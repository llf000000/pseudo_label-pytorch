# Pseudo-Label The Simple and Efficient Semi-Supervised Learning Method for Deep Neural Networks

The repository implement a semi-supervised method for Deep Neural Networks, the Pseudo Label. More details for the method please refer to *Pseudo-Label The Simple and Efficient Semi-Supervised Learning Method for Deep Neural Networks*.

The environment:
- Python 3.6.3 :: Anaconda custom (64-bit)
- Pytorch 0.2.0_3


To run the code:
1. First, you should decompress the data and correct the path.
2. Run `python SemisupNet.py` and `python supNet.py` for comparsion.
3. Or you can open *run.ipynb* in the Jyputer notebook to run the code.
